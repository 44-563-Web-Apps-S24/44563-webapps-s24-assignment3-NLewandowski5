        <p>My favorite music artists are a dj duo that go by the name Sub Zero Project. They produce an<br>
             electronic genre called hardstyle that is popular in the northern part of Europe and Australia.<br>
             I recently went to Germany to see them live for the first time. It was the time of my life!</p>

        <h3>Nolan Lewandowski</h3>

        <p>My favorite movie is Castaway. It is a slightly older movie that stars Tom Hanks. He gets stranded<br>
            on an island by himself after a plane crash. It is a very emotional movie as you see him survive<br>
            on the island for years and make a volleyball friend named Wilson. He then loses Wilson while on a<br>
            raft at sea and it created the phrase "Wilsonnn!" What an excelllent movie!</p>
